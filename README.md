# Vagrant box for CKAN 

This attempts to use the ansible script from the (https://github.com/GSA/ckanext-geodatagov) GSA CKAN repository to make a dev setup.

## Simple Setup

1. Install the latest [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Install the lastest [vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)
3. Install [pip] (https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html), or `$ sudo easy_install pip`
4. Once PIP is installed, follow with [ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html), or `$ sudo pip install ansible`
5. Clone this repository, e.g. `$ git clone --recursive clone git://github.com/ckan-vagrant-geodatagov.git`
6. Move to the directory with your terminal application `$ cd ckan-vagrant-geodatagov/`
7. Make sure the submodule is there, if you didn't use recursive, then do the following: 
	`$ git submodule init` - then, `$ git submodule update`
8. Create the instance with VirtualBox with this command: `$ vagrant up` - if it cannot find VirtualBox from Step 1 or if it isn't configured correctly, it will attempt to do so here.  If you encounter errors, you can try using sudo: `$ sudo vagrant up`
9. Go get some coffee (it takes a few minutes)
10. Add to following line to `/etc/hosts` on your local machine:  `192.168.19.97 ckan.lo`
11. Open [http://ckan.lo](http://ckan.lo) in your browser.
	
You can log into your machine with the ```vagrant ssh``` command which will use keys that are autogenerated. That's the easiest way, but you should also be able to use standard ssh with a username and password: ```$ ssh 192.168.19.97 -l root``` - the password is ```vagrant```
